## Project Description

The Student Enrollment System is a web-based application designed to store and manage student data in a relational database named "SCHOOL-DB." This system provides a user-friendly interface for adding, updating, and resetting student records. The primary key for the "STUDENT-TABLE" relation is the student's Roll No.

## Benefits of Using JsonPowerDB

- **High Performance:** JsonPowerDB offers high-speed data storage and retrieval, making it an ideal choice for managing student records.

- **Scalability:** The system can handle a growing number of student records, ensuring scalability as your educational institution expands.

- **Data Validation:** JsonPowerDB allows for efficient validation of data, ensuring that no empty fields are saved in the database.


## Scope of Functionalities

The Student Enrollment System offers the following key features:

1. **Enroll Student:**
   - Enter the student's Roll No, Full Name, Class, Birth Date, Address, and Enrollment Date.
   - The system ensures that all fields are filled before saving the data.
   - Click the "Save" button to store the data in the SCHOOL-DB database.
   - The system will reset the form for enrolling another student.

2. **Update Student Data:**
   - Enter the student's Roll No to check if it exists in the database.
   - If the Roll No is found, update the student's Full Name, Class, Birth Date, Address, and Enrollment Date.
   - Click the "Change" button to save the updated data in the SCHOOL-DB database.
   - The system will reset the form for updating another student or enrolling a new one.

3. **Reset Form:**
   - Users can reset the form to its initial state, allowing them to start over or update another student record.

4. **Data Validation:**
   - The system checks for empty fields and prevents saving incomplete data to the database.
