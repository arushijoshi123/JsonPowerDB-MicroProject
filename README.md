## Project Description

The Student Enrollment System is a web-based application designed to store and manage student data in a relational database named "SCHOOL-DB." This system provides a user-friendly interface for adding, updating, and resetting student records. The primary key for the "STUDENT-TABLE" relation is the student's Roll No.

## Benefits of Using JsonPowerDB

- Simplest way to retrieve data in a JSON format.
-Schema-free, Simple to use, Nimble and In-Memory database.
-It is built on top of one of the fastest and real-time data indexing engine - PowerIndeX.
-It is low level (raw) form of data and is also human readable.
-It helps developers in faster coding, in-turn reduces development cost.


## Scope of Functionalities

The Student Enrollment System offers the following key features:

1. **Enroll Student:**
   - Enter the student's Roll No, Full Name, Class, Birth Date, Address, and Enrollment Date.
   - The system ensures that all fields are filled before saving the data.
   - Click the "Save" button to store the data in the SCHOOL-DB database.
   - The system will reset the form for enrolling another student.

2. **Update Student Data:**
   - Enter the student's Roll No to check if it exists in the database.
   - If the Roll No is found, update the student's Full Name, Class, Birth Date, Address, and Enrollment Date.
   - Click the "Change" button to save the updated data in the SCHOOL-DB database.
   - The system will reset the form for updating another student or enrolling a new one.

3. **Reset Form:**
   - Users can reset the form to its initial state, allowing them to start over or update another student record.

4. **Data Validation:**
   - The system checks for empty fields and prevents saving incomplete data to the database.
